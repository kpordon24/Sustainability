This project developed three types of Python-based machine learning models capable of predicting financial and ESG performance.

### There are six Jupyter notebooks:

Stages 1 to 3: Business problem statement through data preparation

Stage 4: Exploratory data analysis

Stage 5 Revenue: Develop and evaluate models that identify features that drive and predicted revenue

Stage 5 ESG Score: Develop and evaluate models that identify features that drive and predict ESG score

Stage 5 Market Cap: Develop and evaluate models that identify features that drive and predict market capitalization
